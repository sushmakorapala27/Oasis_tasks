# Oasis Company Internship Projects

Welcome to the repository documenting the projects I completed during my internship at Oasis Company. These projects encompass a range of machine learning tasks aimed at solving real-world problems. Below, I provide an overview of each project:

## Car Price Prediction
In the **Car Price Prediction** project, we leveraged linear regression to build a predictive model. This model helps estimate the prices of cars based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. We extensively evaluated the model's performance to ensure its accuracy and reliability in pricing predictions.

## Iris Flower Classification
The **Iris Flower Classification** project involved the application of machine learning techniques to classify Iris flowers into different species. We explored several models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), to achieve accurate classification results. This project showcases the versatility of machine learning algorithms in solving classification problems.

## Sales Prediction
In the **Sales Prediction** project, we focused on predicting sales figures using linear regression. By analyzing historical sales data and relevant factors, we developed a predictive model to forecast future sales trends. This project is a testament to the practical applications of machine learning in sales and revenue forecasting.

Each project folder in this repository contains detailed documentation, code, and resources related to that specific project. Feel free to explore and learn more about the methodologies, techniques, and insights gained during my internship at Oasis Company.

I hope these projects serve as valuable examples of the practical application of machine learning in solving real-world business challenges. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any aspect of these projects, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I look forward to your feedback and collaboration.
